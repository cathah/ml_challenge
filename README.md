## Introduction

This repo contains a Jupyter notebook investigating a smart scheduling solution for a restaurant. It features a demand forecasting model to predict hourly order quantities as well as a staffing solution designed to optimise Orders per labour hour (OPLH). Several interactive graphs are included within the notebook also.


## Installation & Running the Notebook

* Please clone the repo. All commands in this README are run at the repo level.

* To load the project requirements, I recommend using venv. This project was built using Python 3.6.5. The project requirements are found in requirements.txt and can be loaded when inside of the environment. Alternatively tools such as Conda are popular for working with Jupyter notebooks.

```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    pip install -r requirements.txt (alternatively: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt)
```

* To start the notebook please use the following command to open the notebook in your browser.

```sh
    jupyter notebook
```
